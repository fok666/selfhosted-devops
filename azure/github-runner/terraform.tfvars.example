# VM Configuration
# ============================================================================
# ARM64 (Ampere Altra) instances offer up to 50% cost savings vs x86-64
# See DOCKER_IMAGES.md for architecture-specific considerations
#
# x86-64 (Intel/AMD):
#   Standard_D2s_v3    - 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM   ~$24/month spot
#   Standard_D2as_v4   - 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM   ~$19/month spot (AMD)
#   Standard_F2s_v2    - 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM   ~$18/month spot (CPU-optimized)
#
# ARM64 (Ampere Altra):
#   Standard_D2ps_v5   - 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM   ~$12/month spot (50% savings!)
#   Standard_D4ps_v5   - 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM  ~$24/month spot (50% savings!)
#   Standard_E2ps_v5   - 2 vCPU, 16GB RAM  ~$14/month spot (memory-optimized)
#
# All Docker images support both architectures automatically

# Docker Image Configuration
# ============================================================================
# See DOCKER_IMAGES.md for complete image variant documentation and cost analysis
#
# Available variants:
#   latest  - Full toolchain (Docker, Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Cloud tools) ~2.5GB
#   minimal - Docker + Git only (cost-optimized) ~500MB
#   node    - Docker + Node.js + npm/yarn ~1.2GB
#   python  - Docker + Python 3.11 + pip/poetry ~1.1GB
#   golang  - Docker + Go 1.21 ~1.3GB
#   cloud   - Docker + AWS CLI + Azure CLI + kubectl ~1.8GB
#
# Multi-architecture support: Both x86-64 and ARM64 automatically detected
# Cost impact: Smaller images = faster startup + lower storage costs
#
# Examples:
#   "fok666/github-runner:latest"  - Production workloads (full tools)
#   "fok666/github-runner:minimal" - Cost-optimized (simple builds)
#   "fok666/github-runner:node"    - JavaScript/TypeScript projects
#   "fok666/github-runner:cloud"   - Kubernetes/IaC deployments
#   "fok666/github-runner:1.2.3"   - Pin to specific version (production)
